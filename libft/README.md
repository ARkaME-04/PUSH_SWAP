## Description
**Libft** is the first personal C library developed during the 42 curriculum.  
The goal of this project is to reimplement a set of standard C library functions and to build additional utility functions that will be reused throughout future projects.

This project focuses on:
- Understanding how standard libc functions work internally
- Managing memory safely and efficiently
- Respecting strict coding rules (Norm, Makefile constraints, no leaks)
- Building a reusable static library (`libft.a`)

The library is divided into three main parts:
1. Reimplementation of libc functions  
2. Additional utility functions  
3. Linked list manipulation functions  

---

## Instructions

### Compilation
- To compile the library, run:
``make``
This will generate the static library libft.a
- Remove object files:
``make clean``
- Remove object files and the library:
``make fclean``
- Recompile everything:
``make re``

## Library Content
### Part 1 — Libc Functions

- Reimplemented standard C functions such as:
1. Character checks (`ft_isalpha`, `ft_isdigit`, …)
2. Memory manipulation (`ft_memcpy`, `ft_memmove`, `ft_memset`, …)
3. String handling (`ft_strlen`, `ft_strlcpy`, `ft_strchr`, …)
4. Conversion utilities (`ft_atoi`, `ft_calloc`, `ft_strdup`)

All functions follow the behavior described in their respective man pages.

## Part 2 — Additional Functions

- Utility functions not directly available in libc, including:
1. String manipulation (`ft_substr`, `ft_strjoin`, `ft_strtrim`, `ft_split`)
2. Conversions (`ft_itoa`)
3. Functional string iteration (`ft_strmapi`, `ft_striteri`)
4. File descriptor output helpers (`ft_putchar_fd`, `ft_putstr_fd`, `ft_putendl_fd`, `ft_putnbr_fd`)

## Part 3 — Linked List Functions

- Available linked list utilities:
1. Node creation and insertion (`ft_lstnew`, `ft_lstadd_front`, `ft_lstadd_back`)
2. List inspection (`ft_lstsize`, `ft_lstlast`)
3. Memory management (`ft_lstdelone`, `ft_lstclear`)
4. Iteration and mapping (`ft_lstiter`, `ft_lstmap`)

These functions provide a foundation for dynamic data structures used in later projects.

## Resources

### Documentation & References
- Linux man pages (man strlen, man malloc, etc.)
- GNU C Library documentation
- BSD libc documentation (for strlcpy, strlcat)
- 42 intranet project documentation

### AI USAGE
AI tools were used strictly as a support tool, never to directly generate solutions.
They were used for:
- Debugging assistance
- Typo detection
- Code readability checks
- Verifying edge cases and logic consistency
- Minor documentation and formatting help

All algorithmic choices, implementations, and problem-solving were done manually in accordance with the 42 AI usage policy.

## Notes & Disclaimer
- The project strictly follows the **42 Norm**
- All memory allocations are handled carefully to avoid leaks
- No global variables are used

The library is intended to be reused in future 42 projects
